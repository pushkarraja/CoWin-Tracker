•	Developed an Android app that allows users to search for COVID-19 vaccination slots based on pincode and date.
<br>
•	Implemented a user-friendly interface using card views to present information in a visually appealing manner.
<br>
•	Utilized the Volley library for efficient networking and data retrieval from a government API.
<br>
